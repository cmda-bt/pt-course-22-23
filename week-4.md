## Assignments

### Refactor

![Refactor Banner](assets/banners/banner-refactor.jpg)

> Ensure your code (and repo in general) is neat-o

#### Synopsis
- **Time**: 3h-4h (depending on your work so far)
- **Due**: before week 5

> Anyone can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write
> code that humans can understand.
>
> [Martin Fowler](https://twitter.com/martinfowler/status/1067179181140844544)

The code you write will be _executed_ by computers, but it will exclusively be
_read_ by humans. Therefore, it's critical that your code is easy to read,
understand, and "mentally parse". Go back into your work so far and make sure
that everything you've done so far is easy to understand for "outsiders" to your
project.

#### Assignment

* **Pick (minimum) 5 of the Clean Code JavaScript concepts** from the GitHub repo and refactor parts of your client and or server-side JavaScript code. Additionally clean-up any other code that needs refactoring. **Document what you refactored with _before_ and _after_ code blocks in your wiki.**
* **Tweak or set-up additional linters** (see week-3) in your project. It will further help you spot any inconsistenties in your code. 
* **Ask your support group to review your work**, and optimize your code
based on the questions they ask. It can be surprisingly difficult to find problems in work you're too familiar with. 
* Make sure that files like your `.env` file (with your private information), `node_modules` and other files that are not part of your project, are listed in `.gitignore` and are **not present** in your repo.
