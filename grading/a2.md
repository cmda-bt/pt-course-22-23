## Assessment 2 - Team

You've worked iteratively (_formative_) on your product and finish with an oral test (_summative_) where you **present your final prototype** with your **team**. You've combined all your job stories into one complete matching application. It's important that your team makes decisions together based on consensus. Also, split work per feature (such as liking) instead of per area (such as templating).

First you'll present the whole project as a team to all the teachers. Then you'll show how you contributed to the project and explain if you reached your own goals you've set at the beginning of the project. 

You will answer questions in such a way as to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals.

> **This is a team assignment but you'll be graded individually!** Each prototype contains an individually recognizable contribution of you based on the learning goals and topics of this course. So, you need to show you worked on something for back-end. For example; you can't just _work on the CSS of the project_ because that was your role in the team.

> **This is an assessment, not another moment for feedback.** So you will be graded. There isn't much time for additional feedback or troubleshooting technical issues.

### Preparation

Since we have limited time make sure you come to the assessment prepared:

- **Bring your computer** and make sure it's _charged_ and connected to _Wifi_.
- Have the latest version of your feature **ready in your browser**.
- Have the latest version of your code and wiki **ready on GitHub**.
- Have the latest version of your code **ready in your editor**.

> Make sure your repository stays online after the assessment is finished, we might want to check the code handed in on GitHub after the assessment. We also want to download and archive your project when it’s done.

> _Each of this rubric’s rows is cumulative:_ for example, to get a 5-6 on concept, you also need to have a 1-2 and 3-4.

### Guidelines
* A teacher can [refuse to take the assessment][refuse] when you show up late regardless of the reason. That means you go straight to the re-sits and will be graded with a `1.0`. Usually teachers give you a small window of time after the assessment(~5 minutes) to show up.
* We don’t like plagiarism and report it to our assessment committee (examencommissie in Dutch).
* Grades will be published and communicated trough Brightspace.
