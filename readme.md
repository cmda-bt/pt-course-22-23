## Description
Project Tech is your first stepping stone to become a well-rounded web developer (or a designer with knowledge of how things are made). You'll build a dynamic prototype of a matching application. You’ll learn about the “softer” skills; reading documentation, collaboration and “harder” skills; how to use the command line, version control, build tools, and code quality.

We’ll focus on what it means to be a web deveveloper, the current landscape of that space, and topics such as privacy, security, diversity, inclusion, accessibility, communication and team work.

Project-tech is an elective course given in Quarter 3 (spring) after the core curriculum of our programme, building further on knowledge acquired in *Internetstandaarden*, *Inleiding Programmeren*, and *Blok Web*. This course is chosen alongside **Frontend 2** and **Back-end**, together making up Block Tech. 

If you’d like to continue with web development after this course, do a tech internship, choose the [Tech Track][track] for the fall semester next year, and pick [Minor Everything Web][minor] in the spring semester after that. Just a quick check if anyone actually reads this: if you see this, please send your teacher a picture of your favorite animal.

_Project-tech is part of the  CMD Amsterdam **design & build space** (technical course) that focusses on   Conceptualizing (2), Imagining and creating (3), Multidisciplinary collaboration (5) & Research (9) competences._ 

## Communication

*   [GitHub][gh] — Main source of information, slides, assignments and more
*   [Microsoft Teams][teams] — General chatter and Q&A
*   [Brightspace][brightspace] — Schedulers, rubrics and grading

> This course doesn't have office hours. Teachers have limited time to help you outside of class. Attendance to class is not compulsory. 80% of success in this course is showing up, so show up and come prepared with your questions. 
  

If you have questions:

*   Read the manual for the technology in question
    ([Git](https://git-scm.com/docs),
    [GitHub](https://guides.github.com),
    [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/),
    [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs))
*   [Browse examples][examples]
*   [Search StackOverflow][stackoverflow]
*   [Use a search engine like DuckDuckGo][duckduckgo]
*   [Ask questions on MS Teams][teams] (don't ask to ask and no hello)

> Asking good questions is a skill. [Don't ask to ask][ask] and [no hello][hello]. Read more about asking questions and being helpful in the [`docs`](/docs) folder.
